## What is libESMTP?

**libESMTP** is an SMTP client which manages submission of electronic mail via
a preconfigured Mail Transport Agent (MTA) such as
[Exim](https://www.exim.org/) or [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/).

libESMTP relieves the developer of the need to handle the complexity of
negotiating the SMTP protocol by providing a simple API. Additionally
libESMTP transparently handles many SMTP extensions including authentication.

Refer to the [libESMTP Documentation](https://libesmtp.github.io/)
for further information.
