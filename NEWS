* libESMTP 0.8.0 development release.	2000-06-12

- See ChangeLog for details.

The libESMTP feature set and API for version 1.0 is more or less complete.
There have been minor changes to the arguments or semantics of some of
the API functions, particularly wrt. the callback functions.  Applications
using previous libESMTP versions will need to be recompiled or relinked.

From this point on no new features will be added and, as far as possible,
API changes will be resisted.  Having said that, the range of error codes
will likely be expanded.  Effort will now be directed at bug fixes and
improving the documentation and web site, though this is likely to be a
slow process.

Many of the supported SMTP extensions have had only superficial testing
mainly due to lack of access to servers supporting them.  Developers using
libESMTP are encouraged to test extensions against servers to which they
have access and to submit bug reports to <brian@stafford.uklinux.net>.

The libESMTP web site will be updated in the near future to set up
(finally!)  mailing lists and bug tracking.  In addition the web site will
link to projects using libESMTP.  If you would like a mention for your
project, drop a line to <brian@stafford.uklinux.net> with the details.
